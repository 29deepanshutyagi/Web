    Index Funds are
    <strong>passive mutual funds that mimic popular market indices.</strong>
    <br>
    The Fund Manager doesn’t play an active role in selecting industries and
    stocks to build the fund’s portfolio but simply invests in all the stocks
    that make up the index to be followed. The weightage of the stocks in the
    fund closely matches the weightage of each of the stock in the index. This
    is passive investment i.e the fund manager simply copies the Index while
    building the fund’s portfolio and tries to maintain the portfolio in sync
    with its index at all times.
    <p>
      If the weight of a stock within the index changes, the fund manager must
      buy or sell units of the stock to have its weight in the portfolio aligned
      to that of the index. While passive management is easier to follow, the
      fund doesn’t always produce the same returns as that of the index due to
      tracking error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracking error occurs because it is always not easy to hold the securities
      of the index in the same proportion and transaction costs are incurred by
      the fund in doing so. Despite tracking error, index funds are ideal for
      those who don’t want to take the risk of investing in mutual funds or
      individual stocks but would like to gain from exposure to the broader
      market.
